    "\"r\" (read-only mode) - opens the file for reading only. This is the default mode if no mode is specified.\n",
    "\"w\" (write mode) - opens the file for writing. If the file exists, its contents will be truncated and overwritten.\n",
    "If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\"a\" (append mode) - opens the file for writing, but data is appended to the end of the file if it already exists.\n",

    "\"x\" (exclusive creation mode) - opens the file for writing, but only if the file does not already exist. \n",

    "Flushing data to disk: When you write to a file, the data is not immediately written to the disk.\n",
    "Instead, it is temporarily stored in a buffer. When you close the file, the contents of the buffer are flushed to the disk,\n",
    "ensuring that the data is saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventing data corruption: If a file is not closed properly, it may result in data corruption or other issues. For example,\n",
    "if your program crashes or terminates before the file is closed, the file may be left in an inconsistent state,\n",
    "which can cause data loss or other problems.\n",
